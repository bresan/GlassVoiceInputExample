# GlassVoiceInputExample

This is a simple project I've made a few years ago using the Google Glass Development Kit (GDK).

It has the file structure of the Eclipse Android Projects, but I'm pretty sure you can import to Android Studio without any issues.

In case of any doubt, feel free to ask (opening an issue or sending me a message).
